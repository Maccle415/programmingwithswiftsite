Hi all! My name is Darren and welcome to Programming with Swift. 

I am a web developer, and I have been developing for the web since 2013. In 2013 I also got my first mac and wanted to try out iOS development and immediately I knew that I wanted to start building apps. Unfortunately I built one app and then stopped for a while. But now I have decided that I need to properly dig into iOS app development and that is why I am creating this blog.

## Who is this blog for?

To be honest, this blog is for myself. It is suppose to be a place where I will record my thoughts and create tutorials on how I do stuff so that if I need to do something in the future I can just come to the blog and see how I done it the last time.

But it is also for anyone else. If my content can help you then that is also great! 

## Is this blog only about Swift app development?

This blog will mainly be about Swift app development, but I might also include some Objective C every once in a while. I might also try and see if I can get Swift working on Linux and maybe write a small app app or two for Linux.
