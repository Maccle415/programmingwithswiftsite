I never really use 3rd party libraries. I generally find that their documentation is not too great, or it is just that I don't want to have to spend the time finding a good library.

The other day I was looking for some open source projects to go through for Swift to try and improve my knowledge and skills. Reading other developers code is a really good way to do that and I highly recommend reading other developers code.

I found these links below. They are lists of 3rd party libraries and resources for Swift. So whether you like using 3rd party libraries, looking for a 3rd party library for some functionality or just want to read code. The below recourses should help you out.
