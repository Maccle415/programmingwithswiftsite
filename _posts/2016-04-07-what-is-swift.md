Swift is a general purpose programming language created by Apple. It was launched on June 2 2014.

Swift was created for iOS, OS X, tvOS and Linux development. Swift is meant to be a safer language than Objective C. The syntax of Swift looks a little bit like a scripting language, which is helps makes it easier to learn than Objective C.

One of the great things about Swift is that it has playgrounds. This allows one to write simple scripts in the playground environment and save it. Makes testing ideas and prototyping small ideas fast and easy.

## Conclusion:

I think that Swift is going to be one of the great programming languages. Making it open source and available Linux was a fantastic idea. There are a few large companies wanting to invest heavily in Swift. IBM is one of the companies already investing into Swift. They have created a Swift based web framework called <a href="https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura" target="_blank">Kitura</a>.
